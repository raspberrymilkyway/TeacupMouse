# TeacupMouse

More of a proof of concept than an actual game. Built in 12 hours for TigerHacks, because we're bad with time and busy.

TO RUN THIS: download "Build" folder; play "TeacupMouse.exe".

IF YOU'D LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS: we can't figure out how to upload this fully (GitHub says no), so you'd have to have Unity installed. With any luck, just create a new 3D build and import our "Assets", "ProjectSettings", and "UserSettings" folders.
