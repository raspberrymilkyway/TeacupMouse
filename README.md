# TeacupMouse

TO RUN THIS: download "Build" folder; play "TeacupMouse.exe".

IF YOU'D LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS: we can't figure out how to upload this fully (GitHub says no), so you'd have to have Unity installed. With any luck, creating a new 3D build and importing our "Asset", "ProjectSettings", and "UserSettings" folders.
